        <h1>Daytrading</h1>
        <div class="experience">
        <p>Trading stocks has been a hobby of mine ever since high school, and since most people don't have a clear understanding of what I mean, I am going to explain a bit more about what daytrading actually entails. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The idea of daytrading is to find a stock with lots of movement, identify a pattern, buy it and sell it at a higher price on the same day. To most, it's simply a gamble, and the vast majority of people who try it ultimately lose money. And while it can be extremely risky, there are a few traders who have shown that with dedication and time, it is possible to gain consistent profits trading the markets. But how?
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The video to the right is one of my favorite videos that outlines exactly how someone can learn to be a profitable daytrader, and exactly the type of things a trader should be focusing on:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Before watching, there are a few terms that you should know:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Short
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Shorting is the opposite of buying. When you short a stock, you make money when it goes down
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You use borrowed shares in order to sell them and buy them back at a lower price
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With shorting, there is an infinite amount of risk, because you lose money as the stock goes up, and it could go up infinitely
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Small Cap
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        These are stocks with a low market cap, usually under $1B
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Small cap stocks are usually more volatile, therefore better for traders
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Volume
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Volume is simply the number of shares that have been traded on a given day
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Reading a candlestick chart</h2>
        <div class="experience">
            <p>It is crucial to be able to read a candlestick chart in order to be able to properly analyze the price movements. To the right is an image that should help you understand how to read a candlestick chart. It may take some time to get used to, but it should become easier the longer you are using it.</p>
            <p>Try to become familiar with different chart patterns, such as bull flags or ascending triangles. These will help you know when a stock looks like it will go higher.</p>
            <p>Below is included an interactive sample chart so that you can see how they work. Each candlestick represents one day of movement. Take a look at the chart to familiarize yourself and you might even start to recognize some patterns.</p>
